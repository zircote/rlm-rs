# ADR-010: Switch to BGE-M3 Embedding Model

## Status

Accepted

## Context

### Background and Problem Statement

The original embedding model choice (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) was made for its small size and fast inference. However, production usage revealed limitations:
- 384 dimensions provide lower semantic resolution
- ~512 token context often truncates larger chunks
- Multilingual support is limited

BGE-M3 offers significant improvements at the cost of larger model size.

### Current Limitations

1. **Dimension mismatch**: 384 dimensions limit semantic expressiveness
2. **Token truncation**: ~512 token limit truncates chunks near the 2000-byte default size
3. **Multilingual gaps**: MiniLM has limited non-English support

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. **Context coverage**: BGE-M3's 8192 token limit covers full chunks without truncation, provided `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` is kept low enough for dense text (see "Update" section below)
2. **Embedding quality**: 1024 dimensions provide richer semantic representation
3. **Consistency**: Full chunk content is embedded, not truncated

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. **Multilingual support**: BGE-M3 handles non-English content better
2. **Model maturity**: BGE-M3 is well-established in the embedding community
3. **fastembed support**: Both models supported by fastembed-rs

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Switch to BGE-M3

**Description**: Replace all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with BGE-M3 embedding model.

**Technical Characteristics**:
- 1024 dimensions (vs 384)
- 8192 token context (vs ~512)
- ~1.3GB model size (vs ~90MB)
- Stronger multilingual support

**Advantages**:
- Full chunk coverage without truncation (given a chunk-size ceiling sized to the token limit — see "Update" section below)
- Higher semantic resolution
- Better multilingual embeddings
- More accurate semantic search

**Disadvantages**:
- Larger model download (~1.3GB vs ~90MB)
- Slightly slower inference
- Breaking change: requires schema migration
- Existing embeddings must be regenerated

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: Low. fastembed-rs supports BGE-M3 well
- **Schedule Risk**: Low. Simple model swap
- **Ecosystem Risk**: Low. Well-established model

### Option 2: Keep all-MiniLM-L6-v2

**Description**: Maintain current model.

**Technical Characteristics**:
- 384 dimensions
- ~512 token context
- ~90MB model size

**Advantages**:
- Smaller model download
- Faster inference
- No migration needed

**Disadvantages**:
- Continued truncation issues
- Lower semantic quality
- Limited multilingual support

**Disqualifying Factor**: Token truncation undermines semantic search quality for typical chunk sizes.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: None. No change
- **Schedule Risk**: None. No change
- **Ecosystem Risk**: Low. Status quo

### Option 3: External Embedding API

**Description**: Switch to OpenAI or similar API embeddings.

**Technical Characteristics**:
- API-based embedding generation
- Higher quality models available
- Requires network and API key

**Advantages**:
- Access to latest models
- No local model storage

**Disadvantages**:
- Network dependency
- Privacy concerns
- API costs
- Conflicts with offline-first design

**Disqualifying Factor**: Violates offline-first and privacy principles established in ADR-007.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: Low. APIs are simple
- **Schedule Risk**: Low. Easy integration
- **Ecosystem Risk**: High. API dependency

## Decision

Switch from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to BGE-M3 as the default embedding model.

The implementation will:
- Change `EmbeddingModel::AllMiniLML6V2` to `EmbeddingModel::BGEM3`
- Update `DEFAULT_DIMENSIONS` from 384 to 1024
- Add schema migration (v2→v3) to clear incompatible embeddings
- Keep model download silent (existing behavior)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Full chunk coverage**: 8192 tokens handles any reasonable chunk size, provided `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` is kept low enough for dense text (see "Update" section below)
2. **Better search quality**: 1024 dimensions capture more semantic nuance
3. **Multilingual improvement**: Better handling of non-English content
4. **Future-proof**: More headroom for chunk size increases

### Negative

1. **Breaking change**: Existing embeddings incompatible (different dimensions)
2. **Larger download**: ~1.3GB model vs ~90MB
3. **Slower inference**: Larger model has higher compute cost
4. **Migration required**: Users must regenerate embeddings after upgrade

### Neutral

1. **Model download timing**: Same lazy loading pattern as before

## Decision Outcome

BGE-M3 provides a significant quality improvement for semantic search. The migration clears existing embeddings, requiring users to re-embed their content, but this is a one-time cost for lasting quality improvements.

Mitigations:
- Schema migration (v2→v3) automatically clears old embeddings
- Clear error messages guide users to re-embed
- Document migration in CHANGELOG
- Lazy loading preserves cold start for non-embedding operations

## Update (2026-07-14, issue #313)

The "full chunk coverage without truncation" claims above assumed `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
(the only enforced ceiling on chunk size, in `src/chunking/mod.rs`) was itself
small enough to guarantee chunks stay under BGE-M3's 8192-token limit. That
was not the case: at the original `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 50_000` characters, dense
text (source code, CJK) can run at well below the ~4 chars/token assumed for
English prose — this project's own `estimate_tokens_for_text` heuristic
(`src/core/chunk.rs`) treats non-ASCII text as ~1-2 chars/token — so chunks
well under the 50k-character ceiling could still exceed 8192 tokens and be
silently truncated by fastembed's tokenizer on embed — the same class of
silent-truncation problem this ADR was written to eliminate, just recurring
at a higher, less obvious threshold.

`MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` has been lowered to `24_000` characters (~8k tokens at a
conservative ~3 chars/token), which comfortably covers source code and
typical mixed-language content. This is a simple, low-risk mitigation, not
a hard guarantee: very CJK-dense content can still run denser than the
~3 chars/token assumption, and could in principle still exceed 8192 tokens
at the new ceiling. Closing that gap fully would require token-aware
validation at chunk time (issue #313's suggested fix option 1, using the
existing `Chunk::estimate_tokens()`/`estimate_tokens_accurate()`), which
was deliberately deferred in favor of this smaller, immediate fix. The
"full chunk coverage without truncation" claims above should be read with
that caveat.
